#-------------------------------------------------------------------
# Definition of tile groups that are separately scheduled
# and prioritized. All tiles in the footprint must be assigned
# to exactly one group.
#
# Group names are arbitrary strings. The tiles associated with a
# group can be optionally restricted using:
# - cap = N or S.
# - dec_min or dec_max limits.
# - covers keyword specifies previously defined subgroups that the tiles in
#   this group cover (for fiber assignment).
# Groups are also associated with a list of passes, with each pass
# defining a subgroup.
#
# Each subgroup has associated rules that specify its relative weight
# when selecting the next tile in the scheduler.
#
# Rules are assigned separately for each subgroup using the notation:
#
#   GROUP_NAME(PASS): { ...rules... }
#
# By default, each subgroup has an initial weight of zero when the
# survey starts (so will not be scheduled), unless it has an explicit
# start rule:
#
#   START: INITIAL_WEIGHT
#
# Additional rules of the form:
#
#   GROUP_NAME(PASS): NEW_WEIGHT
#
# specify the subgroup weight that will be assigned when the specified
# subgroup has been completely observed. Forward references to subgroups
# that have not been defined yet are ok.

# This is a simplified set of rules that just does pass N before N+1 within
# each of the DARK, GRAY, BRIGHT subset of layers.

DARK:
    dec_order: +0.2
    passes: 0,1,2,3
    rules:
        DARK(0): { START: 1.0 }
        DARK(1): { DARK(0): 1.0 }
        DARK(2): { DARK(1): 1.0 }
        DARK(3): { DARK(2): 1.0 }

GRAY:
    dec_order: +0.2
    passes: 4
    rules:
        GRAY(4): { START: 1.0 }

BRIGHT:
    dec_order: +0.2
    passes: 5,6,7
    rules:
        BRIGHT(5): { START: 1.0 }
        BRIGHT(6): { BRIGHT(5): 1.0 }
        BRIGHT(7): { BRIGHT(6): 1.0 }
