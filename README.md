# DESI Survey Planning and Scheduler

This package provides the tools to plan and schedule observations of the
predefined tiles in the DESI footprint, each associated with an observing
program (DARK/GRAY/BRIGHT). The algorithms in this package do not deal with
individual targets or their assignment to fibers.

See the `surveysim` package for a driver that uses randomly generated weather conditions to simulate a survey.
