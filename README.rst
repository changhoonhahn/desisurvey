DESI Survey Planning and Scheduler
----------------------------------

This package provides the tools to plan and schedule observations of the predefined tiles in the DESI footprint, each associated with an observing program (DARK/GRAY/BRIGHT). The algorithms in this package do not deal with individual targets or their assignment to fibers.

See the ``surveysim`` package for a driver that uses randomly generated weather conditions to simulate a survey.  In particular, this `tutorial <https://github.com/desihub/surveysim/blob/master/doc/tutorial.md>`__ is a good starting point.
